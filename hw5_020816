Database normalization can be thought of as a trade off between data redundancy and performance.  Normalization is the process of systematically examine relations for anomalies, and when found, removed.  The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then reproduce through the rest of the database.  Data that has multiple values, however, must be stored differently.  Different forms of databases require different types of normalization, data stored in one form could not correctly represent the data.
