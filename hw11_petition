I signed a petition on MoveOn.org in support of Obamacare.  I think that healthcare for everyone is something that is very important, and underrated.  There are thousands of Americans who need healthcare, but can't afford it, including myself.  I had an injury in December 2014, that I am in need of healthcare; physical therapy, medication, etc., and I could not have afford any of it.  I am truly grateful to Obamacare, and hope the same system stays in place.
