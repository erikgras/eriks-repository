DEF CON 23 - Eric XlogicX Davisson - REvisiting RE DoS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbih2lG2v0s

I chose this video mainly because i've just recently taught myself basic command line linux, and have played around with DDoS attack scripts.  I also think with the security today, DDoS attack methods are going out of style.  I haven't had much success with anything DDoS related, I think exploits are more of the type of methods that are more effective.  I haven't heard much of any DDoS website takedowns lately.  I don't know if the security technology is too strong for DDoS attacks or what.  Obviously I know DDoS attacks prevalent, but I am curious of the current DDoS attack scripts and methods, and it's extremely interesting to me.
